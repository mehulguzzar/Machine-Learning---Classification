# Machine-Learning---Classification

This project was implemented as part of the ML-2 Module to perform classification using the various ML algorithms

Using ML algorithms, to bring out conclusions and forecast decisions on the cardio dataset which contains the details of patients.
With the obtained details, we have to arrive at a conclusion if the patient
has cardiovascular disease or not and also to help them take preventive measures.
