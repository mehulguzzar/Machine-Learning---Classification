# Machine-Learning---Classification

This project was implemented as part of the ML-2 Module to perform classification using the various ML algorithms

Using ML algorithms, to bring out conclusions and forecast decisions on the cardio dataset which contains the details of patients.
With the obtained details, we have to arrive at a conclusion if the patient
has cardiovascular disease or not and also to help them take preventive measures.

## The dataset contains the following features:

**id** : It's just the Id no of the row. (Not revelant)

**age** : It's the age of a person in Days.

**gender** : It's the gender of the person.

**height** : It's the height of the person in cm.

**weight** : It's the weight of the person in kg.

**ap_hi** : It's the Systolic blood pressure i.e. Pressure exerted when Blood is ejected in arteries. Normal value : 120mmhg or Below.

**ap_low** : It's the Diastolic blood pressure i.e. Pressure exerted when Blood exerts between arteries and heartbeats. Normal Value : 80mmhg or Below.

**cholesterol** : It's the Cholestreol value (Cholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood) of your blood. In Adults, 200 mg/dL is desired with 200 and 239 mg/dL as Boderline High. In Children, 170 mg/dL is desired with 170 and 199 mg/dL as Boderline High.

**gluc** : It's the Glucose Level. They're less than 100 mg/dL after not eating (fasting) for at least 8 hours. And they're less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours after eating. For most people without diabetes, blood sugar levels before meals hover around 70 to 80 mg/dL.

**smoke** : It contain Binary Values stating whether Person is a Smoker or not i.e. {0 : 'Not a Smoker', 1 : 'Smoker'}

**alco** : It contain Binary Values stating whether Person is an alchoalic or not i.e. {0 : 'Not a Alchoalic', 1 : 'Alchoalic'}

**active** : It contain Binary Values stating whether Person is involved in physical activites or not i.e. {0 : 'Not involved in Physical Activites', 1 : 'involved in physical activites'}

**cardio** : It's our Target Value Binary Values stating whether Person has Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or Not i.e. {0 : 'Not Have CVD', 1 : 'Have CVD'}
